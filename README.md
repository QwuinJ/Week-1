# Week-1
Challenges from CN Master Course Week 1

These are challenges and activites completed by me on the first week of the CN Master course. 

I also created a virutal pet project, found here: https://github.com/QwuinJ/Virtual-Pet

And a poetry shuffler, found here: https://github.com/QwuinJ/Autumn-Poem-Generator
